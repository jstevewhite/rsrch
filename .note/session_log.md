**Summary:** Merged WARP.md context into project memory.
**Details:**
- Detected `WARP.md` was newer than `project_memory.md` (13:36:04 vs 13:35:06).
- Integrated key information from `WARP.md`: MCP tools availability, stage pattern, intent-aware processing, Phase 1 priority.
- Updated "Current Focus & Next Steps" to reflect Phase 1 priority (web search & scraping).
- Added MCP tools (`search_web`, `read_url`, parallel variants) to Key Components.
- Added new decisions: use MCP tools instead of SERP API, intent-aware processing strategy.
- Fixed markdown linting issues (blank lines around headings, lists, code blocks).
