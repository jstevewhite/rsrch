# Web Scraping Options Comparison

## Available Options

You have **three** scraping options available:

1. **serper-api-mcp's `get_url`** - Uses Serper Scrape API
2. **Warp's `read_url` / `parallel_read_url`** - General-purpose MCP scraping tools
3. **Custom scraper** - Roll your own with BeautifulSoup/requests

## Detailed Comparison

### 1. Serper-API-MCP's `get_url`

**How it works:**
- Sends URL to Serper's scrape endpoint (`https://scrape.serper.dev`)
- Returns cleaned content or HTML
- Truncates to 15,000 characters by default
- Uses your existing Serper API key

**Pros:**
- ✅ Already configured (same API key as search)
- ✅ Single provider for search + scraping (consistency)
- ✅ Professional scraping service (handles JS, proxies, etc.)
- ✅ Simple MCP interface
- ✅ Likely handles rate limiting

**Cons:**
- ❌ **Costs money** (uses Serper API credits)
- ❌ Truncates content to 15k chars (may lose data)
- ❌ Less control over parsing
- ❌ Dependent on external service availability
- ⚠️ May not be optimized for batch operations

**Best for:**
- Quick prototyping
- Simple content extraction
- When you want a single provider for everything
- Sites with heavy JavaScript or anti-scraping measures

---

### 2. Warp's `read_url` / `parallel_read_url`

**How it works:**
- General-purpose MCP web scraping tools
- Likely uses a headless browser or smart parser
- `parallel_read_url` can fetch multiple URLs simultaneously
- Returns clean markdown format

**Pros:**
- ✅ **Free** (no per-request costs)
- ✅ Parallel fetching built-in (`parallel_read_url`)
- ✅ Optimized for batch operations
- ✅ Returns clean markdown (easier to process)
- ✅ MCP-native (consistent with Warp ecosystem)
- ✅ No truncation limits (likely)
- ✅ Designed for content extraction use cases

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Need to test reliability on different sites
- ⚠️ May have different capabilities than Serper
- ❌ Two different tools/servers (Warp + Serper)

**Best for:**
- **Production use** (cost-effective)
- Scraping multiple URLs at once
- Getting full content (not truncated)
- When you need clean, processed text

---

### 3. Custom Scraper (BeautifulSoup + requests)

**How it works:**
- Write Python code with requests + BeautifulSoup
- Full control over parsing logic
- Handle chunking, metadata, etc.

**Pros:**
- ✅ Complete control over parsing
- ✅ No external service dependencies
- ✅ Free (no API costs)
- ✅ Can customize for specific sites
- ✅ Full content (no truncation)

**Cons:**
- ❌ More code to write and maintain
- ❌ Need to handle errors, retries, rate limiting
- ❌ Doesn't handle JavaScript-heavy sites
- ❌ More complex testing
- ❌ Proxy/anti-scraping handling is your problem

**Best for:**
- When you need very specific parsing logic
- Sites with special formatting
- When you want zero external dependencies
- Learning purposes

---

## Recommendation: 🏆 Use Warp's `read_url` / `parallel_read_url`

### Why This is the Best Choice:

1. **Cost-Effective** 💰
   - Serper charges per scrape request
   - Your research pipeline might scrape 10-50 URLs per query
   - At scale, this gets expensive fast
   - `read_url` is free

2. **Designed for This Use Case** 🎯
   - Built for content extraction
   - Returns clean markdown (perfect for LLM processing)
   - Parallel fetching built-in
   - No arbitrary truncation

3. **Better Architecture** 🏗️
   - Separation of concerns: Serper for search, Warp for scraping
   - Each tool does what it does best
   - More resilient (not dependent on single provider)

4. **Scalability** 📈
   - `parallel_read_url` can fetch multiple URLs simultaneously
   - Better performance for batch operations
   - No rate limit concerns with paid API

### When to Use Serper's `get_url` Instead:

Only use Serper's `get_url` if:
- ❌ Warp's `read_url` fails on specific sites
- ❌ You need JavaScript execution
- ❌ You encounter heavy anti-scraping measures
- ❌ Cost is not a concern

**Keep it as a fallback option!**

## Implementation Strategy

### Recommended Approach: Primary + Fallback

```python
class Scraper:
    def scrape_url(self, url: str) -> ScrapedContent:
        try:
            # Primary: Use Warp's read_url (free, clean markdown)
            content = call_mcp_tool(
                name="read_url",
                input={"url": url}
            )
            return self._parse_content(content, url)
            
        except Exception as e:
            logger.warning(f"read_url failed for {url}, trying Serper fallback: {e}")
            
            try:
                # Fallback: Use Serper's get_url (costs money, but reliable)
                content = call_mcp_tool(
                    name="get_url",
                    input={"url": url}
                )
                return self._parse_content(content, url)
                
            except Exception as e2:
                logger.error(f"Both scrapers failed for {url}: {e2}")
                raise
    
    def scrape_urls_parallel(self, urls: List[str]) -> List[ScrapedContent]:
        """Scrape multiple URLs efficiently."""
        try:
            # Use parallel_read_url for batch efficiency
            results = call_mcp_tool(
                name="parallel_read_url",
                input={
                    "urls": [{"url": url} for url in urls]
                }
            )
            return [self._parse_content(r, urls[i]) for i, r in enumerate(results)]
            
        except Exception as e:
            logger.warning(f"Parallel scraping failed, falling back to sequential: {e}")
            # Fall back to sequential scraping
            return [self.scrape_url(url) for url in urls]
```

### Benefits of This Approach:
- ✅ Use free tool by default
- ✅ Fallback to paid service when needed
- ✅ Resilient to failures
- ✅ Cost-optimized
- ✅ Parallel processing when possible

---

## Cost Analysis

### Example Scenario:
- 100 queries per day
- Each query searches 5 different search terms
- Each search returns 10 URLs
- You scrape top 3 URLs per search
- Total: 100 × 5 × 3 = **1,500 scrapes/day**

### Monthly Costs:

| Option | Cost per Scrape | Monthly Cost (45k scrapes) |
|--------|----------------|----------------------------|
| Warp `read_url` | **$0** | **$0** |
| Serper `get_url` | ~$0.003-0.01 | **$135-450** |
| Custom (hosting) | Variable | ~$5-20 |

**Savings: $135-450/month by using Warp's tools!**

---

## Testing Commands

### Test Warp's read_url:
```bash
# Single URL
warp mcp call read_url '{"url": "https://python.org/about/"}'

# Parallel (multiple URLs)
warp mcp call parallel_read_url '{
  "urls": [
    {"url": "https://python.org/about/"},
    {"url": "https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html"}
  ]
}'
```

### Test Serper's get_url:
```bash
warp mcp call serper-api-mcp get_url '{"url": "https://python.org/about/"}'
```

### Compare results and choose!

---

## Final Recommendation

### Primary: Use Warp's `read_url` / `parallel_read_url`
- Free
- Clean markdown output
- Parallel processing
- Designed for content extraction
- Better for production at scale

### Fallback: Keep Serper's `get_url` as backup
- Use when Warp's tool fails
- For JavaScript-heavy sites
- For sites with anti-scraping

### Avoid: Custom scraper
- Not worth the complexity
- MCP tools are better maintained
- Only if you have very specific needs

## Update WARP.md

The WARP.md should reflect:
1. Primary tool: `read_url` / `parallel_read_url`
2. Fallback tool: `get_url` (from serper-api-mcp)
3. Implementation strategy with both options
