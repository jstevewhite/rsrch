# Scraping Strategy - Corrected Recommendation

## The Reality: MCP Tools Are Not Available to Python Scripts

**Important Clarification:**
- MCP tools (`read_url`, `parallel_read_url`, etc.) are available **only through Warp/Claude**
- Your Python script **cannot** directly call MCP tools
- Jina.ai's MCP server tools **also cost money** (not free)

## Available Options for Python Script

### Option 1: Use Serper's `get_url` Only
**How it works:**
- Call Serper's scrape API directly
- Costs ~$0.003-0.01 per scrape
- Professional service, handles JS

**Pros:**
- ✅ Already have API key
- ✅ Handles JS, anti-scraping
- ✅ Simple integration

**Cons:**
- ❌ Expensive at scale ($135-450/month for 45k scrapes)
- ❌ Truncates to 15k characters
- ❌ Less control

### Option 2: Roll Your Own with BeautifulSoup ✅ RECOMMENDED
**How it works:**
- Use Python's `requests` + `BeautifulSoup`
- Free, full control
- Handle 95%+ of normal websites

**Pros:**
- ✅ **Free** (no per-request costs)
- ✅ Full content (no truncation)
- ✅ Complete control over parsing
- ✅ Can customize for specific needs
- ✅ Easy to maintain

**Cons:**
- ❌ Doesn't handle JS-heavy sites
- ❌ Need to implement error handling
- ❌ More code to write

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach ⭐ BEST OPTION
**Use BeautifulSoup for most sites, keep Serper as manual fallback**

## Recommended Strategy

### Primary: BeautifulSoup + requests (Free, 95%+ of sites)

```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

def scrape_url(url):
    headers = {'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0 ...'}
    response = requests.get(url, headers=headers, timeout=10)
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')
    
    # Remove non-content tags
    for tag in soup(['script', 'style', 'nav', 'footer']):
        tag.decompose()
    
    return soup.get_text(separator='\n', strip=True)
```

**Handles:**
- ✅ Most blogs, articles, documentation sites
- ✅ News websites
- ✅ Static content sites
- ✅ Most academic papers (HTML versions)

**Doesn't handle:**
- ❌ Heavy JavaScript sites (React, Vue, Angular)
- ❌ Sites with aggressive anti-scraping
- ❌ Dynamic content loaded after page load

### Fallback: Note Sites That Fail

When BeautifulSoup fails on specific sites:
1. Log the failure
2. Document which sites need special handling
3. Later, you can implement Serper fallback for those specific domains

**This way you:**
- Pay $0 for 95%+ of scrapes
- Only pay for truly difficult sites
- Know exactly what you're spending on

## Implementation

### Already Created: `stages/scraper.py`

```python
class Scraper:
    def scrape_results(self, search_results):
        # Uses BeautifulSoup for all URLs
        # Logs failures for later analysis
        # Can add Serper fallback later for specific domains
```

**Features:**
- ✅ BeautifulSoup scraping
- ✅ Proper error handling
- ✅ Logging
- ✅ User-Agent spoofing
- ✅ Content cleaning

## Cost Comparison

### Monthly Costs (45k scrapes):

| Strategy | Cost | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|
| **BeautifulSoup Only** | **$0** | ✅ Recommended |
| Hybrid (95% BS, 5% Serper) | ~$7-23 | If you need fallback |
| Serper Only | $135-450 | ❌ Expensive |

## When to Add Serper Fallback

Add Serper's `get_url` fallback **only if**:
1. You encounter many JS-heavy sites
2. Failure rate > 10%
3. Cost is not a concern

**Until then:** Start with BeautifulSoup only, document what fails.

## How to Add Serper Fallback Later

If needed, you would implement it through Warp/Claude:

```python
# This would be manual/semi-automated through Claude
# NOT direct Python API call (MCP tools aren't accessible)

# 1. Python script tries BeautifulSoup
# 2. Logs failure
# 3. You (or automated process) use Claude/Warp to call:
#    call_mcp_tool(name="get_url", input={"url": failed_url})
# 4. Save result manually
```

## Recommended Approach

### Phase 1: Start Simple (Now)
1. ✅ Use `stages/scraper.py` with BeautifulSoup
2. ✅ Log failures
3. ✅ See what works

### Phase 2: Analyze (After Testing)
1. Check failure rate
2. Identify which sites fail
3. Decide if fallback is needed

### Phase 3: Add Fallback (If Needed)
1. Implement Serper fallback for specific domains
2. Or use Jina.ai r.jina.ai (simpler: `requests.get('https://r.jina.ai/https://url')`)
3. Only for sites that consistently fail

## Jina.ai Alternative

If you need a paid fallback, Jina.ai's **r.jina.ai** is simpler than MCP:

```python
# Direct API call (no MCP needed!)
url = "https://example.com"
response = requests.get(f"https://r.jina.ai/{url}", 
                       headers={"Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_JINA_KEY"})
content = response.text  # Clean markdown!
```

**Jina.ai r.jina.ai:**
- ✅ Returns clean markdown
- ✅ Direct HTTP API (no MCP complexity)
- ✅ Handles JS sites
- ⚠️ Costs money (check pricing)

## Final Recommendation

**Start with BeautifulSoup only:**
1. ✅ Free
2. ✅ Simple
3. ✅ Works for 95%+ sites
4. ✅ Already implemented

**Add fallback later only if:**
- Failure rate is high (>10%)
- You need JS-heavy sites
- Budget allows

**Best fallback option if needed:**
- Jina.ai r.jina.ai (direct HTTP API, clean markdown)
- OR Serper get_url (through MCP/Claude manually)
