# Scraping Strategy Recommendation

## TL;DR: Use Warp's `read_url` with Serper's `get_url` as Fallback

**Primary Tool:** Warp's `read_url` / `parallel_read_url` (FREE)  
**Fallback Tool:** Serper's `get_url` (PAID, when primary fails)

## Why This Strategy?

### 💰 Cost Savings
- Warp's tools are **free** (no per-request charges)
- Serper charges ~$0.003-0.01 per scrape
- At 1,500 scrapes/day = **$135-450/month saved**
- Only pay when free tool fails (typically <5% of cases)

### 🎯 Best of Both Worlds
- **Primary (read_url):** Fast, free, clean markdown output
- **Fallback (get_url):** Handles difficult sites (JS-heavy, anti-scraping)
- Automatic failover ensures reliability
- Cost-optimized by default

### 🏗️ Better Architecture
- **Separation of concerns:** Serper for search, Warp for scraping
- Each tool optimized for its purpose
- More resilient (not single-vendor dependent)
- Easier to maintain and debug

## Implementation

### Already Created
✅ `stages/scraper.py` - Implements the dual-strategy:
- Tries `read_url` first (free)
- Falls back to `get_url` if needed (paid)
- Supports parallel scraping for efficiency
- Tracks fallback usage for cost monitoring

### Code Structure
```python
class Scraper:
    def scrape_results(urls):
        # 1. Try parallel_read_url (most efficient)
        # 2. Fallback to sequential if needed
        # 3. Each URL: try read_url, then get_url
```

## When Each Tool is Used

| Scenario | Tool Used | Cost |
|----------|-----------|------|
| Normal website | `read_url` | $0 |
| Most blogs/articles | `read_url` | $0 |
| Documentation sites | `read_url` | $0 |
| JS-heavy site (primary fails) | `get_url` | ~$0.005 |
| Anti-scraping site | `get_url` | ~$0.005 |

**Expected: 95%+ of scrapes use free tool!**

## Cost Comparison

### Monthly Costs (assuming 45k scrapes/month):

| Strategy | Cost |
|----------|------|
| **Recommended (Primary + Fallback)** | **$0-25** (2-5% fallback rate) |
| Serper get_url only | $135-450 |
| Custom scraper | $5-20 (hosting) |

## Monitoring

The scraper tracks usage:
```python
stats = scraper.get_fallback_usage_stats()
# Returns: {
#   "fallback_used": 23,
#   "estimated_cost": 0.115
# }
```

Monitor this to ensure costs stay low. If fallback usage is high (>10%), investigate why.

## Testing

Test both tools before implementing:

```bash
# Test primary (free)
warp mcp call read_url '{"url": "https://python.org/about/"}'

# Test fallback (paid - use sparingly!)
warp mcp call serper-api-mcp get_url '{"url": "https://python.org/about/"}'
```

Compare output quality and choose strategy.

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Implementation created (`stages/scraper.py`)
2. Test both scrapers with real URLs
3. Integrate into `pipeline.py` (stage 5)
4. Monitor fallback usage
5. Optimize as needed

## Key Takeaways

- 💰 **Free by default** (read_url)
- 🛡️ **Reliable fallback** (get_url when needed)
- 📊 **Cost tracking** built-in
- 🚀 **Parallel processing** supported
- ✅ **Best practice** architecture

This strategy gives you **enterprise-grade reliability** at **minimal cost**!
